## Description
<p align="justify">FitnessApp1 is my thesis project, which is divided into two parts: the server component and the mobile application. FitnessApp1 is designed to monitor health indicators with the aim of promoting healthier living. <br>The app tracks the number of steps walked daily. Users can log the amount of water they consume throughout the day, as well as the foods they eat. Additionally, users can track changes in their height and weight. <br>Each user has automatically set daily goals for water, calorie, protein, carbohydrate, and fat intake. These goals are based on the userâ€™s preferences and data.</p>
